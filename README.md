# Blackjack - A simple blackjack game with GUI

This project is a simple game of blackjack that I made to learn more about **Tkinter** and **Python**, as well as asyncronous programming with **async** and **threads**. This game is only in spanish but there is not much to read… [Jugar means play, gana means win, pierde means looses, empate means draw etc…](https://www.deepl.com/en/translator) Note that the code itself (and it's comments) are in English. And if the code looks messy it’s because I made it in a hurry in a few days. **Finals are eating my time and I do not**
**intend to improve this code for the foreseeable future.**

Mind specifically the playsound module version as the latest one doesn't seem to work as it should.
